## Ever found yourself endlessly scrolling through online stores, only to stumble upon the same product being sold by multiple sellers, each offering it at slightly different prices?

I find online shopping to be such a whirlwind experience, there are times when I am shocked by the consistency of the same product being sold by various sellers, the only difference is that the price is a fraction less or a fraction more. I am sure many of us have experienced this whilst online shopping and I won’t lie and say I haven’t purchased something that didn’t look fake. I very much have and unfortunately, it’s hard to ignore when the price is too good.

We can spot the fake from a mile away yet it’s a habit we continue to make, buying products that are not always transparent. Why do we do it? Well, cause it’s cheap, convenient, and quickly delivered. It is not only beneficial to you and me but also to the seller. In this current economy I am sure that all of us would love to find the most efficient and effective ways to make money, without having to do much of the workload, I mean it’s the dream right? But, is it the most ethical thing to do?

## Drop-Shipping 

Drop-shipping, if you don’t know already, is an effective way of making money without needing to take on a lot of the responsibility. If you drop-ship, you do not need products in stock, instead, your business sells a product from a third-party supplier who then ships the order to the customer.

## Perks

Of course, drop-shipping has its perks, for customers, it’s cheap and convenient, for businesses it’s a cost-effective way of testing different products and niches, and it comes with low margins meaning the best kinds of products are those that are unlikely to be returned because they are of a low price or simple and unlikely to break. If you want to market simple, unique products that are shipped quickly, go ahead and give it a try! It doesn't hurt to try, and many have been successful.

## Drop or Not To Drop?

Drop-shipping isn’t for everyone nor should it be saturating the market like it is today. Nowadays, I am questioning what products are made authentically due to the abundance of drop-shipping businesses that have filtered through online shopping platforms. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great when you find a deal on a product especially if money is tight, like it is for many of us now. But, what if you dropped the drop-shipping and spent your money on businesses that have put their heart and souls into their products? Investing in custom-made, personally shipped, high-quality products that will last twice as long as drop-shipped items may come at an additional cost, but the money you spend will go towards something more worthwhile.

Drop-shipping has potential if done with genuinely good products and transparency but, does it pose a threat to independent businesses that have the potential to grow and succeed? Will you drop-the-drop-shipping and go local?

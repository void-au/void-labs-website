## God, what a waste!

Something I would say regularly when I’d forget that my past self had decided that, yes I do need this fitness app on my phone, it’s only $14 a week! What’s the harm, right?
Wrong.

Unfortunately, there is more harm than good done to my bank account than my past self anticipated. But I guess I’m the one to blame for that decision or am I?

Should we blame ourselves for making those decisions or are we under the subscription spell? A spell much like a bad relationship; you want to leave and try to but, in the end, you keep coming back for more.

## An Unhealthy Relationship

Like any unhealthy relationship, a subscription is like rose-coloured glasses but the true identity of it is when those glasses finally crack and your bank account soon drops to new lows. You, like anyone else, fundamentally see the opportunity it could bring to you and you take it, no questions asked, unless you’re good with your money, unlike myself.

## The Rose-Coloured Glasses: The advantages of subscriptions

I won’t lie and say subscriptions are 100% terrible because they do have their advantages:

**Do you want convenience?** Look no further, subscriptions are just that. All you need to do is pay a small fee regularly and you’ll be provided all the benefits you need or want.

**Are you looking for great value for money?** Don’t wait, jump! As a customer, in addition to your regular fee, you will receive discounts and competitive prices that could be extremely beneficial for anyone on a budget.

**Do you want your personality to shine?** Well, subscriptions can do that too! As a customer, you will find products and services based on your previous purchases and search history.

## The Crack In The Glass: The disadvantages of subscriptions

Unfortunately, there are disadvantages to being under the subscription spell:
Are you tired? Don’t worry, me too, as a subscriber you are becoming more fatigued, known as ‘subscription fatigue’, by the overwhelming amount of subscription services and rising costs. There is so much that it’s too much and the price of it keeps growing.

**Do you need psychological relief?** There are so many of us who need it, the endless scroll of options on Netflix is a far cry from the old days. When the need for a product becomes more difficult than satisfying, we look elsewhere. Not only do we as a customer decide to use a different subscription service but, the business itself loses a customer.

**Are you no longer surprised?** Me neither, it is funny how hard subscriptions try to improve their products and services with the ‘IT’ factor but at the end of the day, it’s always the same, just a different version.

## It’s Not Always Roses: How to find a better solution to the subscription spell (Cont.)

- **Spring Clean:** If you are like me and forget you even had a subscription in the first place, this is the time to spring clean your subscriptions. Its beneficial to understand your subscription usage, track your spending, and determine what you deem appropriate to maintain for the future.

- **Budget:** Another suggestion would be to consider a new budget made only for subscriptions, this way you have a more accurate understanding of how your money moves, streamlining how you track your income and expenses.

- **Shop around:** Research and compare prices, and see what subscription services will give you the most bang for your buck. Consider what you need, and the value and convenience you are looking for in a subscription service.

## It’s Not Always Roses: How to find a better solution to the subscription spell (Cont.)

- **Take advantage:** Don’t stop using the subscription if it offers a free trial, give it a few days and see if it works for you. You can always cancel it if you want to, the choice is yours.

- **Share:** You can save money by sharing your subscriptions with family, depending on the terms and conditions, that way you can pitch in a smaller amount of money and still maximise your use of the service.

- **Cold Turkey:** If you’re stronger than I am, you could ultimately quit cold turkey and go the traditional route. Forget all the subscriptions, go out and do it on your own. You never know, it could be way more fun than you might think.

The impact of the subscription spell is evident in my bank account and maybe yours too, it is bittersweet to say that the current economy has made us more aware of the expense of subscriptions and I’m sure many of us now have had to sacrifice entertainment for survival.

But, what if life did turn around, and one day we all could afford more, spend more, we must wonder; will we get our money’s worth, or will we be subtly drawn into the unhealthy relationship that a subscription spell has?

Are we ready to take control back, or will we let the rose-coloured glasses shield us from the inevitable?

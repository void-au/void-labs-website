## Do you ever feel like someone is watching you or listening to every word you say?

You might sound crazy if you said this to a friend or family member, even a stranger, don’t get me wrong though I have been in that very boat before. Today’s technology is so advanced that it can easily track where we go, watch our very movements daily, and even listen to certain keywords or phrases which will turn their gears on to work as a service to you.

Have you ever experienced a time when you had a thought or spoken about a certain thing and then, oops, it suddenly appeared on your Facebook or Google feed? You haven’t? Maybe that’s just me…

Believe it or not, our whole lives and our personalities are surveilled. Let me debrief you on what that means if you don’t know already, there are many tools, that 99% of us have i.e., a smartphone, that are made for collecting and sharing data.

Smartphones produce and hold huge amounts of personal data including who we talk to, where we go, our internet browsing history, our social networks, and so much more. Even the very mundane appliances we have such as dishwashers, coffee machines, and clothes dryers, TVs, all now connect to the Internet and store small amounts of data. This data can be collected and analysed to provide insights into consumer behaviour. In saying that, it can also intrude on people’s rights to their privacy and safety.

Our right to privacy is coming under even greater pressure from the use of these modern networked digital technologies whose features make them intimidating tools for surveillance, control, and possible abuse. What is used to catch and prevent crime is now also seen as terrorism against us as civilians, for instance, mobile hacking, social engineering, network surveillance, facial recognition technologies, GPS tracking and so much more.

If you are reading this and thinking “Oh, you are just being paranoid.” let me further explain why I might be discussing this; China is pushing to develop a nationwide ‘Social Credit System’ which could be seen as a nightmare of total surveillance. According to some media, China’s ‘Social Credit System’ will be used as scoring board for each citizen. 

Each citizen's social media connection, purchase histories, location data, facial recognition, video footage, and more will all be used to gather the data for this scoring board. This "Social Credit System" will be our era's "Black Mirror," determining who gets access to housing, employment, and even transportation.

Sounds like a dystopian future to me and with how advanced technology is becoming we might very well be in the same boat one day. The universal theme is that with more cameras and more surveillance, the better security and the safer we are, which has shown to be true however, what’s your take

<br />
Do you think surveillance technologies are really making us safer, or could we be unintentionally opening the door to unforeseen dangers?

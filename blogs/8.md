## Have you ever wondered what you would look like in 80 years or if you could switch your gender, how you might look different from how you look now?

The wide range of mobile applications that can alter your face in such bizarre and dramatic ways is fascinating, almost too fascinating. Not only is it entertaining, but you can ask your loved ones to join you and share the experience since, most of the time, it's funny and makes everyone laugh.

<br />

It is possible to argue that there is a danger among the crowd, even though these photo-editing applications are mostly harmless and intended for entertainment. You may never discover that someone has taken it upon themselves to use your voice, face, or profile for malicious intent, even if you post these pictures or videos to social media sites, mobile apps, family, or friends. All is well and good until you discover your face prominently displayed on a pornographic website, and there's no guarantee you would ever discover this or know it for that matter.

## Deep-Dive into the "Deep Fake"

In case you are unaware, this calculating and malevolent behaviour is referred to as "Deep Fake." It is, to put it simply, a video or image of a person whose face or body has been digitally altered to make them appear to be someone else. This type of content is frequently used maliciously or to disseminate false information.

"Deep Fakes" can do a great deal of harm. They have been used to produce false pornographic films and fake news, and they are frequently directed at well-known individuals like politicians and celebrities. It is even employed as a tool for defamation, intimidation, harassment, identity theft, extortion, and sexual exploitation.

Sadly, someone who is the target of "Deep Fakes" could lose money, have their professional or social image damaged, feel afraid, embarrassed, ashamed, lose their self-worth, or become less confident.

## Australia's Pursuit

Sharing "Deep Fake" pornography in Australia will now carry harsh criminal penalties thanks to new legislation that was just submitted to the federal parliament. The punishment for sharing non-consensual "Deep Fake" sexually explicit content is six years in prison. A person faces a higher penalty of seven years in prison for an aggravated offence if they also created the "Deep Fake" shared without permission.

## Look out for the Fake

Lucky for us, there are ways in which we can identify a “Deep Fake”, this can be done by:

- Looking for inconsistencies in lighting, shadows, and reflections.
- Pay attention to and analyse the audio, there may be unnatural or inconsistent audio quality.
- Compare it with known sources, because “Deep Fakes” are often created with two or more existing videos or images you may be able to identify the discrepancies.
- Or, use “Deep Fake” detection tools which have been developed to help identify “Deep Fakes” and can help analyse various aspects of the media (i.e., facial expressions, eye movements, and skin textures).

But here's something to think about: how can we protect our identities and personal data as technology advances and blurs the boundaries between reality and digital manipulation? Have you ever wondered how much of what we see and hear in the digital world is reliable, as well as what safety precautions we can take in this constantly shifting environment?

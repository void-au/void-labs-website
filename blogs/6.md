## Have you ever wondered if the future of money lies in your hands or in the click of a button? Let's explore the journey from cash to clicks and the implications of a cashless society.

When I was younger my parents would give me twenty dollars (cash) as pocket money, to them it was just twenty dollars but, to me, it was as if I won a million dollars. Holding that crisp, pink twenty-dollar bill in my hand felt like a victory, especially after all the tedious work I had done before I received it.

Nowadays, the money I earn doesn’t match that feeling because it’s not deposited into my hands but into my bank account. Money always makes people happy, but nothing compares to the feeling of holding real cash in your hands and knowing that only you have the power to keep or spend it.

When I first started using online banking, I believed that it was the best option because it was protected, safe, and secure. I even thought that it was so handy to have all of it via the access of my personal devices. However, is it really the final frontier of money management? Could we be looking at a cashless society?

## Challenges & Controversies

Now I would be lying if I said I always use cash but, I don’t however, I cannot see going cashless the easiest and most sustainable option for everyone. We may not be living in a cashless society as of right now but, we might as well be since 2018 it was believed that a cashless future was two or three generations away however, since the pandemic it has appeared to accelerate the move towards a cashless society.

In 2022, Australia saw card payments dominate, while cash payments dropped to 13% from 69% in 2007. In response, banks like CBA and ANZ phased out over-the-counter cash transactions, causing challenges for those relying on face-to-face financial help. Australian banks are under fire and with these controversial changes sparking there are now calls for governments to step in and protect communities.

## Exploring the Benefits of a Cashless Future

Indeed, a cashless society brings certain advantages. These can include a lower crime rate, as carrying cash can make someone an easy target for criminals. It may also aid in tracking illegal transactions such as money laundering, gambling, or drug operations.

## Exploring the Risks of a Cashless Future

However, a cashless society also brings its share of drawbacks. First, it can lead to a loss of privacy, as every transaction leaves a digital trail. There may also be monthly fees for maintaining secure digital accounts. Additionally, the risk of cybercrime, such as hacking into online banking, increases. There can be technical issues that may hinder access to funds. Economic inequality may also widen, with those from less developed or poorer regions finding it harder to access digital money. Lastly, the ease of digital payments might lead to overspending, as there's no physical money to hand over - just a simple tap and go.

While some envision a cashless society as the ideal future, it's crucial to consider our diverse needs and preferences. The decision of how we manage our money should not rest solely on major banks, but rather, we should have control over how our funds are distributed, whether through physical cash or digital means. Nowadays, every purchase we make is documented and stored, and a cashless society could result in us losing not only our power but also our privacy.

Could a future where cash is obsolete truly serve everyone in the long run, and would such a system be sustainable and efficient given the potential implications?

This clearly exemplifies the saying 'putting our money where our mouth is'.
